### Hi, I'm Oscar, a student developer from Australia!

Currently I'm developing my school tracking app [Schooly](https://schoolyapp.school). It lets students easily keep track of their timetable and any upcoming due work. It's got all the latest iOS goodies like iCloud sync, widgets, Siri Shortcuts and of course, multiple app icons ;)
